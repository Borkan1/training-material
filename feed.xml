With a commitment to battling work duplication across the multiverse, this community is boldly charting a course for global domination, proving that when it comes to bioinformatics, the Galaxy is the limit!✨</p>

<h1 id="tools--workflows">Tools &amp; Workflows</h1>

<p>The past year has been a spectacular journey in advancing tools and workflows within the Galaxy Single-cell Community. Breaking free from the confines of scRNA-seq, we’ve expanded our horizons to include tools for analyzing data from other modalities such as single-cell ATAC-seq and CITE-Seq. Dive into our updated scRNA-seq analysis tools, now featuring more downstream analysis options for trajectory analysis. We’ve even thrown in advanced analysis tools for estimating cell type proportions from bulk RNA-seq data!</p>

<p><strong>RNA STARSolo</strong> just got a makeover to version 2.7.10b, boasting a revamped UI, Velocyto-like UMI counting, and nifty alternatives for quantifying single nuclei data. Analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data on Galaxy is now a breeze with the introduction of the <strong>EpiScanpy</strong> tool suite, built on the renowned <strong>Scanpy</strong> toolkit. Plus, we’ve added some powerful tools from the <strong>Sinto</strong> toolkit for preprocessing scATAC-seq data on Galaxy. And that’s not all! The <strong>MuSiC</strong> tool suite in Galaxy now unveils deconvolution tools for discovering cell type composition in bulk RNA-seq using cell types within scRNA-seq. Multi-faceted comparisons are now at your fingertips with the <strong>MuSiC Compare</strong> tool.</p>

<p>Seurat fans, rejoice! Updates have rolled in, offering additional functionalities and optional CITE-seq capabilities at runtime.</p>

<h1 id="community-infrastructure">Community Infrastructure</h1>

<p>Our efforts in community building have seen the unification of single-cell subdomains into <a href="https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/">https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/</a>, the creation of the Single Cell Community of Practice hub page (<a href="https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/">https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/</a>), and a user-focused Matrix channel. Testing brilliant widgets, automated updates, and the latest addition of automated help request updates onto Matrix channels have made community collaboration a breeze.</p>

<h1 id="global-connections">Global Connections</h1>

<p>Down under, the Australian BioCommons launched their <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10368976">Single Cell and Spatial Omics Analysis Infrastructure Roadmap for Australia</a>, complementing our endeavors to unite across timezones. Collaboration, including international tool adventures across three continents, proves that team work does, in fact, make the dream work.</p>

<h1 id="fighting-work-duplication">Fighting Work Duplication</h1>

<p>Our mission: No more work duplication! We’ve consolidated single-cell instances and are diligently preventing tool and infrastructure duplication, creating smoother pathways across servers. We value efficiency here at single-cell, so we’d like to thank ChatGPT (free version) for adding in Galaxy puns to this post, as per our request.</p>

<h1 id="what-a-year">What a Year!</h1>

<p>What’s next on our list? World domination or global collaboration? You decide.

One of the compounds my group was working on was piperine, extracted from black pepper. Inspired by literature findings, we found out that the derivatives of piperine can inhibit monoamine oxidase-B and thus can be possibly used in Parkinson’s disease. As a novelty element in our project, we came up with new structures of derivatives that could act as inhibitors.</p>

<p>Before synthesising any new molecules, it would make sense to check if they correctly dock into the active site. As an enthusiastic user and developer of Galaxy, the idea of using GTN came straight to my mind. Even though molecular docking was beyond the scope of our project, I knew that Galaxy and GTN give such an amazing opportunity to do it in the blink of an eye that I wouldn’t be myself if I hadn’t tried! Therefore, by using the <a href="/training-material/topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/cheminformatics/tutorial.html">tutorial on molecular docking</a>, I identified the pocket, then I studied the binding of the approved drugs such as Safinamide and Zonisamide and finally I checked how our proposed molecule fits within the pocket. After that, we were ready to synthesise the derivative we came up with!</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/training-material/news/images/2023-12-18-medchem-user.jpg" alt="Picture of piperine derivative docking into MAO-B pocket." width="1509" height="842" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="/training-material/news/images/2023-12-18-medchem-user.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Piperine derivative as a potential inhibitor of MAO-B</figcaption></figure>

<p>This example shows how GTN and Galaxy can facilitate and accelerate the work of medicinal chemists before starting the synthesis. It is easy to follow the GTN tutorials, the results are reproducible, the datasets are stored in the history and can be easily shared with anyone on the team.</p>]]></content><author><name>Julia Jakiela</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="computational chemistry" /><category term="user story" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a medicinal chemistry student, I undertook a semester project on natural products isolation and derivatisation.

Where previously there were two subdomains each with their own sets of tools, there is now a unified subdomain with re-categorized tools that makes sense for users.</p>

<p>The central page was updated for the first time in years, and some excellent workflow and training search widgets were created. This went hand-in-hand with the creation of the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/">Galaxy Single Cell Community of Practice page</a>.
This infrastructure connects - for the first time - single cell users from novices performing training in Galaxy, to searching more advanced workflows and tools beyond the training, and finally able to contribute, request tools, provide feedback or join the Community of Practice.</p>

<p>Let’s hear from Wendi about the experience.</p>

<h1 id="what-spawned-this-project">What spawned this project?</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Trying to navigate users through all the quirks of Galaxy when they tried to move outside of the tutorials was challenging, and having to explain why we had two sites that both focused on single cell analysis was also tricky. This subdomain makes it a lot easier to communicate the potential to users - they can immediately see how many different toolsuites are available without being overwhelmed. They don’t have to debate whether to learn R or Python, Seurat or Scanpy - they can just try both! Plus, data formats is the thing that stumps users more than anything. My group was constantly losing track of which tool could do what to convert data formats, and I am absolutely thrilled to have an entire section devoted to these random tools that are so vital to applying the analysis to public or private data.</p>

  <p>I had no idea how difficult it would be to make what seemed like quite superficial changes to make the tool panels more usable! José was an absolute star, navigating through all of this seamlessly. Pavan kept finding single cell tools under a ton of different metadata titles, so it was also exciting to see just how many different tools were out there and to get them all in the same place. There’s so much more to play with than I realised! Helena jumped in virtually to make these banging widgets to prevent the sites from becoming outdated, and give contributors more of a voice in the site - if anyone shares a workflow tagged #singlecell on any of the Big 3 public instances, it’s now on our single cell page. I’m so glad we had the CoFest though, because getting together all the different single cell sites, getting all the tools that we found in the right spot, it required the entire day and then some and a lot of collaboration. At one point I was literally highlighting tool IDs in a giant list. It just wouldn’t have been feasible virtually. I’m so excited for the next training session to just see how users navigate the new site.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial-list">Tutorial List</h2>

<p>In order to help her keep her tutorial list updated, we turned every tag on the GTN into an embeddable widget</p>

<iframe src="/training-material/tags/10x/embed.html" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

<p>You can embed a tag by using the url format</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/tags/TAG/embed.html"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="usegalaxy-workflow-list">UseGalaxy.* Workflow List</h2>

<p>We also made a widget for the UseGalaxy.* Workflow List so you can embed the latest and greatest workflows with any given tag/name from any of the UseGalaxy.* servers!</p>

<iframe src="/training-material/workflows/embed.html?query=circos" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

<p>You can embed this workflow listing by using the following code, just swap out your search term!</p>

This gives you more control over both how the GTN looks, and works, for you.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p>This will allow users to set their theme with some more granularity! Previously
you could only choose between a few themes, now these have been split into
separate axes giving you more control over how the GTN renders for you.</p>

<h3 id="brightness">Brightness</h3>

<p>Previously you could switch manually between light and dark themes. Now the GTN
will default to an automatic one that switches the GTN to dark mode when your
system preferences requests it.
Alternatively you can override this and choose a light or dark theme as you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="light-theme">Light Theme</h3>

<p>We’ve added a new light theme with a more yellowed background to be less harsh
on the eyes. When the GTN is using the light mode (automatically or manually)
you can toggle between this and the plain white version.</p>

<h3 id="dark-theme">Dark Theme</h3>

<p>Likewise, now when the GTN is using the dark mode (automatically or manually)
you can choose whether it will use the “night” (dark grey) or “midnight” (pure black) themes.</p>

<h3 id="contrast">Contrast</h3>

<p>Have you ever tried to use some applications in high-light environments, such
as outdoors and found them hard to read? Many websites use unfortunately low
contrast. The GTN now has a slider that allows you to select low, normal
(automatic), or high contrast as is your preference. High contrast will make
all elements a bit more contrasting to ensure you can see them more easily in
those environments.</p>

<h3 id="themes-1">Themes!</h3>

<p>Previously if you wanted the Halloween theme it would only exist on a dark
background, but now you can try them out on any background! The same goes for
all other GTN themes, so please feel free to choose whatever colours suit you,
knowing you’ll be able to use the GTN day and night.</p>

<h2 id="data-privacy">Data Privacy</h2>

<p>The GTN collects very limited information on you as a person. Most of our
developers are located in the EU, and live under GDPR. We do not want your personal data at all.</p>

<p>However we do collect very limited statistics (page views), and error logs via
Sentry (whenever errors occur). If you wish to opt-out of this collection, you
are welcome to do so here.</p>

<h2 id="local-session-storage-and-cookies">Local, Session Storage and Cookies</h2>

<p>Are you curious what information is stored in this browser that’s available to
the GTN to use in displaying itself?
